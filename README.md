## Project Description :memo:

This project leverages extensive datasets to track the growth and trends in the Unicorns ecosystem. Our analysis provides insights into the factors contributing to the success of these billion-dollar start-ups, starting with an overview of the Unicorns' geographic-level expansion, and then focusing on industry-specific developments.

## Datasets :bar_chart:

These are the 4 Dataset which we utilized for our project:<br>
- Unicorns collection of data: <https://dealroom.co/our-data><br>
- Investors collection of data: <https://dealroom.co/our-data><br>
- Capitals' names and others location informations: <https://dealroom.co/our-data><br>
- Startups' data for each country: <https://dealroom.co/our-data><br>


## Hot run the code :gear:

To run the code, open your computers' terminal, and move towards the directory the `app.py`. Refer to the following link: <https://realpython.com/lessons/using-requirement-files/> in order to ensure correct installment of the `requirements.txt`. Ensure that all file libraries are installed. Afterwards, run the follwing code: `streamlit run website_functions.py` to generate the website.


## Libraries :book:
Before running the code, install these libraries:<br>
- `STREAMLIT` : this library enables to run correctly our code on the webpage.<br>
- `PANDAS` : this library enables data manipulation and analysis.<br>
- `NUMPY` : this library enables mathematical and scientific operations on multidimensional arrays.<br>
- `PLOTLY.EXPRESS` : this library enables the creation interactive data visualizations.
- `PLOTLY.GRAPH_OBJECTS` : this library enables the creation customized and highly customizable data visualizations
